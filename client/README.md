# ToDo List ClientSide
This project is a front-end implementation of a ToDo list application built using React. It provides a simple and intuitive user interface to manage and keep track of tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started with the ToDo list application, follow the instructions below:

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js if you haven't already.
## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
### `git clone <https://github.com/kgwitz/ToDoList.git>`

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
### `npm install`

## Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory and provide the neccessary configurations: 
### `REACT_APP_FRONT_END_URL='http://localhost:3000'`
### `REACT_APP_BACK_END_URL='http://localhost:3001'`

## Usage
After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:
### `npm start`

This will start the application on http://localhost:3000 in your default browser.

You can now use the ToDo list application to manage your tasks. Add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them as needed.

To build the production-ready optimized version of the application, use the following command:
### `npm run build`

This will create a build directory containing the optimized and minified version of the application code.
